Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree Project
Translating Python Code to C++

This project is to get students familiar with C++ and it's ability to execute the code faster than python. The drawback with C++ code is that since C++ is a static language, the code is longer and more tedious than it's python counter part.

The main object of this project was to take the code from the python project done earlier in the course, translate it in C++ and run it locally on your computer. 

So far, I have been able to compile the code successfully but my computer keeps crashing the program as soon as i try to run it. I have tried different programs (Codeblocks, Visual Studio 2017 as well running through the terminal). Right now I am not sure what the problem is but I will be trying to figure it out as time goes.
